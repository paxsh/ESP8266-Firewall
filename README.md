Overview
----
The ESP8266 is an amazing low cost device with embedded WiFi. I was unable to find a firewall for it so this is what I(Joe McManus) came up with. A simple firewall/access list.

To import the libary simply go to Sketch -> Include Library -> Add .ZIP Library. 

Update: Blacklist an IP if it tries to access the server more than "n" number of times in less than "m" seconds.
